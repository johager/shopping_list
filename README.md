# Shopping List

This is the second self-assessment project for the Devmountain iOS App Developer Bootcamp.

The app tracks a set of items in a shopping list. Items are added through a UIAlertController and data is persisted using a JSON file. UserDefaults is used to ttrack the next item.id (nextId).

Additions to the baseline project:

- Special welcome add-item alert when the app is launched and there have been no items created.
- The Item includes an amount.
- The ListViewController has two sections: "Not Purchased" and "Purchased".
