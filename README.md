# Shopping List

This is the second self-assessment project for the Devmountain iOS App Developer Bootcamp.

The app tracks a set of items in a shopping list. Items are added through a UIAlertController and data is persisted using a JSON file.

Additions to the baseline project:

- The Item includes an amount
- The ListViewController has two sections: "Not Purchased" and "Purchased"
